Citrix OAuth2 Strategy for OmniAuth.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'omniauth-citrix'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install omniauth-citrix

## Usage

`OmniAuth::Strategies::Citrix` is simply a Rack middleware. Read the OmniAuth docs for detailed instructions: <https://github.com/intridea/omniauth>.

First, create a new application at https://developer.citrixonline.com/user/me/apps. Your callback URL must be something like `https://example.com/auth/citrix/callback`. For development you can use `http://127.0.0.1:3000/auth/citrix`.

Here's a quick example, adding the middleware to a Rails app in `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`. This example assumes you're exporting your credentials as environment variables.

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :citrix, ENV['CITRIX_CONSUMER_KEY'], ENV['CITRIX_CONSUMER_SECRET']
end
```

Now visit `/auth/citrix` to start authentication against Citrix.
